			<h4>Hi! I'm Lady!</h4>
			<p> I was surrendered by my previous owner and am looking for a new one!</p>
			<h4>Stats</h4>
			<p>-Female- Chihuahua Mix</p>
			<p>-Tan/light brown</p>
			<p>-Spayed, Vaccinated, and Microchipped</p>
			<p>-Weight: about 8lbs</p>
			<h4>About Me</h4>
			<p>-I'm a total sweetheart, but sometimes I appear to be nervous around new people or dogs. I promise I'll warm up to you as soon as I sniff every inch of you!</p>
			<p>-I am really smart, and learn fast, but I could use a couple more obedience classes. I already have learned how to sit when you tell me to and I know I can learn so much more.</p>
			<p>-I would do best in a home that has an outdoor area since I love to run. I'm also a cuddler! </p>
			<p>-I would do better with older children rather than younger or an all adult household. I definitely could live with other dogs as long as we are properly introduced first!</p>
			<h4>Oh please won't you take me home? 
				<a href="http://phillypaws.org/adopt-me/?animalID=9037236"> Here is my adoption page! </a>
				<p> If not me, take a look at my other brothers and sisters up for adoption!
