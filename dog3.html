			<h4>Hi! I'm Skooter!</h4>
			<p> I'm currently at a foster home sponsored by PAWS but am looking for a permanent home!</p>
			<h4>Stats</h4>
			<p>-Male- American Eskimo</p>
			<p>-White</p>
			<p>-Weight: about 35lbs</p>
			<h4>About Me</h4>
			<p>-I am very smart, friendly, and alert. I have good manners and have learned not to dig in yards or chew on things that aren't meant for me!</p>
			<p>-I am house trained and know the commands: sit, lay down, give paw, and come.</p>
			<p>-I love to run and play fetch. I've really gotten used to my leash so you don't have to worry about anything!</p>
			<p>-I would do best in a house where I am the only pet and where there are adults rather than children. I promise to be a loving and loyal best friend!</p>
			<h4>Oh please won't you take me home? 
				<a href="http://www.pawschicago.org/pet-available-for-adoption/showdog/skooter/"> Here is my adoption page! </a>
				<p> If not me, take a look at my other brothers and sisters up for adoption!
