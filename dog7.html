			<h4>Hi! I'm Atlas!</h4>
			<p> I've been at the Seattle Humane Society since 11/9/2015!</p>
			<h4>Stats</h4>
			<p>-Male- German Shephard Mix</p>
			<p>-Black/Brown</p>
			<p>-Nautered, Vaccinated, and Microchipped</p>
			<p>-Size: Large</p>
			<h4>About Me</h4>
			<p>-I love to run! I am interested in just about everything I see, so if we go for a walk, make sure you have a strong leash for me! It might be best for my new family to take advantage of the training class offered with my adoption!</p>
			<p>-I already know a few basic commands and may do well in competitions! I love everyone I meet and I can't wait to grow up in a loving household.</p>
			<p>-I would do best with a family that has kids 10 years or older. I think I would be okay with other dogs as long as they are properly introduced, but <strong>no cats </strong> please!! </p>
			<h4>Oh please won't you take me home?
